This is just for showing files required to use the visulization tool. 
You just need to copy all teh files in the `akita/daisen` folder do a go build and you will be presented with a daisen execuatable

To generate the sqlite file run the experiment with `-timing -trace-vis` flag.

To run daise
```
./daisen -sqlite <name of the file>
```
